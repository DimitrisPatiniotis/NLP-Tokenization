Another
concern
:

<BOS>
What
<UNK>
's
so
<UNK>
about
the

'

right
now
is
that
many
are
trading
at
historically
<UNK>
premiums
to
the
value

their
underlying

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
After
trading
at
an
average
discount

20

,
country

currently
trade

The
reason
:

have
climbed
much
more
sharply

It

several

Index

is
a
common
form

program

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
usually
<UNK>
it
takes
advantage
of
a
rather
basic
concept
:
Two
separate
markets
in
different
<UNK>

trading
basically
the
same
<UNK>
,
ca
n't
trade
them
for
long
at
prices
that
are
widely
different
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
In
index
arbitrage
,
the
widget
is
the
S&P
500
,
and
its
price
is
constantly
compared
between
the
futures
market
in
Chicago
and
the
stock
markets
largely
in
New

.
<EOS>
<BOS>
To
profit
from
an
index-arbitrage
opportunity
,
someone
who
owns
the
S&P
500
widget
in
New
York
must
sell
it
and
replace
it
with
a
cheaper
S&P
500
widget
in
Chicago

the

manager

the
return

the
S&P
500
index
,
he
is
likely
to
remain
fully
invested
at
all

,

any

will
risk
<UNK>
performance
by
<UNK>
more
than
100
%
exposure
to
stocks
,
and
equally
few
will
want
to
own
less
than
a
100

-RRB-
<EOS>
<BOS>
By
constantly
seeking
to
own
the
<UNK>
widget
,
index-arbitrage
traders
hope
to
add
between
1
%
and
3
%
to
the
annual
return
of
the
S&P
500
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
That
represents
a
very
thin
``
excess
''
return
,
certainly
far
less
than
what
most
fundamental
stock
pickers
claim
to
seek
as
their
performance
objective
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
fact
that
a
<UNK>
majority
of
<UNK>
money
managers
fail
to
beat
the
S&P
500
may
<UNK>
to
the
<UNK>
<UNK>
the
issue
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
As
more
managers
pursue
the
index-arbitrage
strategy
,
these
small
<UNK>
between
markets
will
be
reduced
and
,
eventually
,
eliminated
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
current
<UNK>
<UNK>
because
the
process
for
executing
a
buy
or
sell
order
in
the
actual
stocks
that
make
up
the
S&P
500
is
more
<UNK>
than
<UNK>
in
the
futures
market
.
<EOS>
<BOS>
The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
attempt
to
introduce
a
new

basket
is
evidence
of

<UNK>

fast

<EOS>
<BOS>
So
if
index
arbitrage
is
simply
taking
advantage
of
thin
<UNK>

two

for
the

The
